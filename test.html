				We were taken from the ore bed and the mine, We were melted in
				the furnace and the pit. We were cast and wrought and hammered
				to design, We were cut and filed and tooled and gauged to fit.
				Some water, coal, and oil is all we ask, And a thousandth of an
				inch to give us play: And now, if you will set us to our task,
				We will serve you four and twenty hours a day
